					<p>
						Who needs a team when you can go solo? Ignore your teammates' calls for teamwork and go rogue.
						After all, it's not about winning together, it's about proving your individual prowess.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the realm of Counter-Strike, information isn't just valuable; it's pure, unadulterated gold.
						But here's the kicker: keep it locked down tighter than Fort Knox! Sharing information with your
						teammates? That's some communist bullshit. In the modern era, it's every player for themselves.
						Why give away your hard-earned intel when you can keep it stashed away like a squirrel hoarding
						nuts for winter?
					</p>
					<p>
						Picture this: you've spotted the enemy lurking around the corner, but instead of alerting your
						team like some naive do-gooder, you keep it to yourself. Let them stumble into the enemy's
						crosshairs while you sit back and farm the trade kills. After all, survival of the fittest isn't
						just a theory; it's a way of life in Counter-Strike. Some may call you a "bAiTeR", they are just
						jealous.
					</p>
					<p>
						And don't even think about calling out enemy positions. That's like handing your teammates a
						treasure map straight to your team's doorstep! Let them figure it out the hard way while you
						bask in the glory of your silent superiority.
					</p>
					<p>
						Remember, in the cutthroat world of Counter-Strike, information isn't just power; it's the
						ultimate currency. So keep it close, keep it secret, and watch as your teammates fall like
						dominoes before you! You can also "accidentally" flash your mates to prevent them to steal your
						kills.
					</p>
					<p>
						Free tip: if you want to look like an exprienced player, play with your knife at the
						spawn and "accidentally" knife your mate, then say "sOrRy i'M uSeD tO pLaY fAcEiT". With their
						reduced HP they will eventually die more easily, leaving more kills for you alone ;-)
